# Hey there, I'm Mert!

First off, thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer with a passion for developing cutting-edge apps and solutions that make a difference in people's lives.

I studied computer engineering and business administration, which gave me a unique perspective on how technology and business intersect, also i went on to pursue an associate degree in computer programming, which really helped me hone my skills in coding.

Aside from my work, I'm a big fan of the outdoors. I love hiking and exploring new trails whenever I can. When I'm not out in nature, you can usually find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes. Cooking is a great way to unwind after a long day of coding!

I'm always striving to learn and grow as a software engineer. I believe that continuous improvement is key to staying at the top of your game in this field. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!
